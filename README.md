### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently pursuing a Master's degree in Biomedical Electronics and Bioinformatics (BEBI) at National Taiwan University (NTU).

As a researcher with a keen interest in Computer Vision, I'm always excited to explore and innovate in this field.

If you have any questions or need guidance, feel free to reach out. I'm more than happy to share my knowledge and insights!
