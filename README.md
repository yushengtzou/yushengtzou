### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a 1st-year MS student in the Digital Camera and Computer Vision laboratory, advised by Prof. Chiou-Shann Fuh in the Graduate Institute of Biomedical Electronics and Bioinformatics, College of EECS, at National Taiwan University (NTU).

As a researcher with a keen interest in Computer Vision, I'm always excited to explore and innovate in this field.

If you have any questions or need guidance, feel free to reach out. I'm more than happy to share my knowledge and insights!
